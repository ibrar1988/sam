                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 1	WHO’S WHO?</strong> “myKlovr” refers to Student Global, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. When “We” or “Us” or “Our” are used in these Terms and conditions, it is a reference to myKlovr. The “myKlovr Platform”
                    refers to this website and all applications and content provided by myKlovr. The myKlovr Platform and its content is designed to comply with U.S. laws and regulations. “You” or “Your” refers to the person using an account created on
                    the myKlovr Platform, or otherwise using the website accessible through <a href="https://www.myklovr.com" target="_blank">www.myKlovr.com</a> or any other component of the myKlovr Platform. If you are using the myKlovr Platform as
                    part of your job, or on behalf of your employer, “You” or “Your” refers to both you and your employer.</p>
                <p><strong>SECTION 2	AGREEING TO THESE TERMS</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 2.1	</strong>If You create an account on the myKlovr Platform, You agree to these Terms and conditions (these “Terms”) by acknowledging Your agreement during the account creation process. If You do not create an account,
                    but use publicly accessible portions of the myKlovr Platform, You agree to these Terms be either accessing the myKlovr Platform or by downloading any application or content provided through the myKlovr Platform, or by using any portion
                    of the myKlovr Platform that is accessible without an account. When You agree to these Terms, You are also agreeing to the terms and conditions in the myKlovr Privacy Policy (available at http://www.myKlovr.com/privacy-policy) (the
                    “Privacy Policy”). The Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 2.2	</strong>If You are acting on behalf of an employer in connection with Your use of the myKlovr Platform or creation of an account on the myKlovr Platform, the person using the myKlovr Platform or creating the account
                    warrants and represents that they have authority and permission to enter into this Agreement on behalf of that employer, in addition to entering into it on behalf of themselves. For avoidance of doubt, if You are acting on behalf of
                    an employer in connection with Your use of the myKlovr Platform or creation of an account on the myKlovr Platform, You are entering into a legal agreement on behalf of yourself personally, and on behalf of your employer.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 2.3	</strong>By accepting these Terms and the Privacy Policy, You (and where applicable, your employer) are entering into a binding legal agreement with myKlovr. If You do not understand these Terms and the Privacy Policy,
                    or if You do not agree to all of the terms and conditions in the Privacy Policy and these Terms, then You may not use the myKlovr Platform or create an account through it. Use of the myKlovr Platform is conditioned on Your acceptance
                    of all of the terms and conditions in these Terms and in the Privacy Policy.</p>

                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 3	SCOPE</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3.1	</strong>myKlovr and its affiliates provide the myKlovr Platform to provide a single source platform for students, parents, teachers and businesses (“Users”) to collaborate to help students of all ages achieve their
                    career and academic goals. Accessing certain features of the myKlovr Platform (for example, and without limitation, such as the marketplace and the institutional reporting features) may require You to enter into separate agreements
                    with myKlovr or its affiliates (“Separate Agreements”). Unless such Separate Agreements expressly reference this Section 3.1 and clearly state that they “are intended to replace or supersede these Terms pursuant to Section 3.1,” all
                    Separate Agreements are in addition to, and not in lieu of, these Terms, and You will be legally bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy in addition to being bound by any such Separate Agreements, all of which will be construed
                    together. Agreement to, and compliance with, these Terms is a condition of all Separate Agreements. Accordingly, a breach by You of these Terms will be deemed and treated as a breach of the Separate Agreements. Failure to agree to
                    this Agreement, or termination of this Agreement by You, prior to the expiration or termination of the Separate Agreements will be a breach of those Separate Agreements.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3.2	</strong>These Terms and the Privacy Policy, as they may be amended from time to time, are collectively known as the “Usage Agreement.” The Usage Agreement applies to all uses of the myKlovr Platform and all user accounts
                    described in any account Information provided to, or received from, the myKlovr Platform and/or through any client or mobile application provided by Us. You understand and agree that this Usage Agreement is enforceable against you
                    personally and any entity with which you are employed or affiliated and on whose behalf the myKlovr Platform or such client or mobile application is used.
                    <br>
                    <strong>You hereby represent and warrant that You have CAREFULLY read and understood these Terms and the Privacy Policy, that You are of legal age under the laws of the United States, and that You accept this Agreement freely, voluntarily, and with full knowledge and understanding of its terms and conditions.</strong>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3.3	</strong>Use of the myKlovr Platform is further conditioned on Your compliance with all terms and provisions of Our Acceptable Use Policy.

                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3.4	</strong>Any conduct that is not in compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy, as amended by Us from time to time, will be a material breach of these Terms.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3.5	</strong>This website and the myKlovr Platform are intended for use only by persons over the age of 13, and only in the United States of America. If You are not over the age of 13 or are located outside the United States
                    of America, You may not use this website. You warrant and represent that You are legally permitted to use this website and other aspects of the myKlovr Platform.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3.6	</strong>If You are between the ages of 13 and 18, You may be required to obtain the consent of Your parent or guardian to use the myKlovr Platform. Such consent may be requested when You create an account on the myKlovr
                    Platform. Regardless of whether such consent is requested or obtained, You acknowledge that these Terms deal with education and, as such, this Agreement is deemed to be an agreement for a necessity.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3.7	</strong>Some portions of the myKlovr Platform are only available for a charge. Others are available without charge. Where there is no charge for using a portion of the myKlovr Platform, We reserve the right to terminate
                    Your access or otherwise deny You the ability or right to use such portions at any time for any reason or no reason, including, without limitation: in the event that We determine, in Our sole discretion, that You are in violation of
                    any these Terms, are outside the United States of America, 13 years old or younger, or that Your use of the myKlovr Platform is not consistent with these Terms, the Privacy Policy or any usage guidelines or policies available on or
                    through the myKlovr Platform, as such may be amended from time to time. Where there is a charge for using a portion of the myKlovr Platform, We reserve the right to terminate Your access or otherwise deny You the ability or right to
                    use such portions at any time in the event that We determine that You have violated any of these Terms, or any term or condition of the Privacy Policy, or any provision of the Acceptable Use Policy. All sales are final and You understand
                    that no refunds will be issued in the event of any termination of the Agreement, regardless of reason.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3.8	</strong>These Terms may be modified from time to time. You can determine if the Terms have been modified by reviewing the version information at the bottom of these Terms. While myKlovr may send provide email notice,
                    in-site notice, or other notice of a modification of these Terms, We are not obligated to do so. You are responsible for periodically reviewing these Terms for any changes. If a change to these Terms has a material adverse effect on
                    You, and no separate written agreement provides otherwise, then You may terminate Your account. Enrollment fees and other fees are not refundable.</p>

                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 4	ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 4.1	</strong>You warrant and represent that all information provided through the myKlovr Platform will be truthful, accurate, and complete, and will be submitted only for lawful purposes. If You provide any information
                    that is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, or if We have any reason to believe that the information You provided is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, or was submitted in connection with any unlawful purpose, myKlovr may, without any
                    liability to You: (a) suspend or terminate Your account or access to the myKlovr Platform; (b) if permitted by applicable law, use electronic self-help means to terminate Your ability to access the myKlovr Platform or other software
                    or services provided by Us; (c) terminate this Agreement; (d) remove, delete or otherwise dispose of Your myKlovr account information previously provided, uploaded or used by, for, or on behalf of You; (e) report Your activities to
                    law enforcement agencies; (f) notify others, including any other users of the myKlovr Platform or Our affiliates or partners of Our suspicions; and/or (g) pursue any other legal or equitable remedies that may be available.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 4.2	</strong>You will grant, and hereby do grant, to Us, a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, unlimited, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable and fully sub-licensable right and license to copy, distribute, publish,
                    perform, create derivatives from, and otherwise use (i) any information, materials or suggestions You provide to Us, either through the myKlovr Platform or otherwise, and (ii) any and all account information, with the exception of
                    Personal Information as outlined in the Privacy Policy, You submit to or through the myKlovr Platform. You warrant and represent that You are the exclusive owner of all information You provide to Us or the myKlovr Platform, or that
                    You have, through valid agreement, the right to provide the account information to Us or the myKlovr Platform and to grant the foregoing license. Although the foregoing license does not terminate, We agree to use commercially reasonable
                    efforts to remove or suspend access to any content You provide to Us upon receipt of Your written request, to the extent such removal or suspension will not place Us in breach of any contractual obligation We have to any other user
                    of the myKlovr Platform. In the event We determine that any content You provide to or through the myKlovr Platform is illegal, infringing, defamatory, abusive, or inappropriate, We reserve the right to unilaterally remove or suspend
                    access to such content at any time with, or without, notice to You. We will have no liability to You whatsoever in event We exercise Our right to remove or suspend access to such content.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 4.3	</strong>You will maintain the confidentiality of any password, user ID, and other account credentials provided to You, created by You, or obtained by You, in connection with the myKlovr Platform, and will not share
                    such information with any third party, or use such information for any purpose not expressly authorized under this Agreement, without myKlovr’s prior written consent. You agree to notify myKlovr in writing immediately of any actual
                    or suspected unauthorized use of Your account credentials, or any other breach of the myKlovr’s security that is known or suspected by You. Notice may be provided by email to support@myKlovr.com, or by overnight delivery to 1350 Avenue
                    of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, New York, 10019.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 4.4	</strong>You consent to the use of electronic communications in transacting business with Us, including, without limitation, the electronic delivery of notices and other documents to You. If at any time You would like
                    to cease doing business electronically with Us, You will need to provide Us with written notice of Your withdrawal of Your consent to do business electronically, which will then terminate this consent. Thereafter, You will not use
                    the myKlovr Platform. No refund will be granted in the event You terminate consent to electronic communication.</p>

                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 5	RENEWAL AND TERMINATION</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 5.1	</strong>To the extent You create an account using, or otherwise register to use, the myKlovr Platform, such account will be active for one month, after which it will automatically renew for successive months unless
                    cancelled by You, or by myKlovr in accordance with this Agreement. Termination of an account does not terminate this Agreement, which may only be terminated by Our written notice to You, or by Your written notice to Us. In the event
                    this Agreement terminates, (i) Your authorization to use the myKlovr Platform will terminate and You will immediately cease all use of the myKlovr Platform (either through a web browser or other software, and either directly or indirectly),
                    (ii) We may, in Our sole discretion, terminate any account and delete or otherwise dispose of any account information or other content provided by You, and (iii) where permitted by law, We may use self-help or other means to prevent
                    further use of the myKlovr Platform by You or others working on Your behalf. It is understood and agreed, however, that the foregoing will not constitute an obligation for myKlovr or any other party to delete or cease use of any account
                    information or other content previously provided to Us, except as otherwise detailed in the Privacy Policy provided. </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 5.2	</strong>If Your account is terminated or suspended for any reason, some of the content You provided to the myKlovr Platform may remain available. For example, and without limitation, if You posted information to a
                    publicly available page on the myKlovr Platform, such postings may remain available.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 5.3	</strong>If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, or if You close Your account or Your account is terminated for any reason, any points or rewards You accrued through the myKlovr Rewards System will be forfeited

                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 6	FEEDBACK AND YOUR POSTINGS</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 6.1	</strong>From time to time, myKlovr or a third party engaged by myKlovr may request feedback and other information from You about the myKlovr Platform or Your experiences with the myKlovr Platform (“Feedback”). You
                    may also choose to participate in forums or to otherwise post content through the myKlovr Platform as You use it (“Postings”). Providing Feedback and Postings is optional. By providing Feedback or Postings, however, You will grant,
                    and hereby do grant, myKlovr a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable and fully sub-licensable right and license to use the Feedback and Postings for any lawful purpose, including, without limitation,
                    the right to reproduce, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, and display all or parts of the Feedback and Postings in any medium whatsoever along with Your (or Your employer’s) name, in myKlovr’s sole discretion. myKlovr may also
                    use the Feedback in anonymous and aggregate reviews.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 6.2	</strong>You agree not to upload, post or otherwise transmit any content that: (a) is inaccurate, harmful, obscene, pornographic, defamatory, racist, violent, offensive, harassing, or otherwise offensive to myKlovr
                    or other users of the website; (b) includes unauthorized disclosure of Personal Information; (c) violates or infringes anyone’s intellectual property rights; or (d) contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs
                    designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment. myKlovr reserves the right to edit or remove content that violates these Terms or for any other reason
                    it considers necessary.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 6.3	</strong>You agree to use the myKlovr Platform in a manner that is lawful, relevant and proper to the applicable forum. Any use of the myKlovr Platform that myKlovr, in its sole discretion, finds inappropriate and/or
                    offensive may result in suspension and/or termination of Your account with or without notice. Conduct that is inappropriate and/or offensive includes, but is not limited to, the following: (a) impersonating another person or allowing
                    any other person or entity to use Your user name, password or membership; (b) reproducing, duplicating, copying, selling, re-selling or exploiting any information, materials or content on the myKlovr Platform; (c) publishing material
                    that includes information that You do not have the right to disclose or make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; (d) publishing content that infringes upon patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights
                    or other intellectual property rights; (e) advertising or offering to sell any goods or services for any commercial purpose on the myKlovr Platform that are not appropriate or relevant to the myKlovr Platform; (f) publishing files
                    that contain software viruses, worms, malware, or any other harmful code, files or programs that interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of the myKlovr Platform or any computer or other equipment; and/or (g) defaming, abusing,
                    harassing, harming, stalking, threatening, or otherwise violating the legal rights (including without limitation rights of privacy and publicity) of others.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 7	OFFENSIVE CONTENT.  </strong>myKlovr reserves the unilateral, unfettered right (but not the legal obligation) to delete or suspend access to any content or information that myKlovr determines, in its sole discretion,
                    is or may be illegal, infringing, defamatory, inappropriate, or offensive. To the extent any such content is posted by You or through Your account, You may be subject to legal action by myKlovr or third parties. myKlovr reserves the
                    right to suspend or terminate Your access to the myKlovr Platform in the event of such postings. Your sole recourse and remedy in the event of such removal is Your right to terminate this Agreement, without the right of receiving any
                    refund. Without limiting the foregoing, myKlovr shall have no liability to You for any lost business, revenue or opportunity resulting from the removal of offensive content. Terminating this Agreement while You are still subject to
                    Separate Agreements may be a breach of Your obligations under those Separate Agreements.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 8	REVERSE ENGINEERING AND NON-INTERFERENCE.  </strong>In addition to any myKlovr information or documents containing information that constitute a “trade secret” as that term is defined in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act
                    as of September 16, 2015, the following will be deemed trade secrets of myKlovr and You will treat the following as Our trade secrets to the extent they have not intentionally been made public by Us: (i) all source code, algorithms,
                    data and configuration files within or comprising the myKlovr Platform or used to receive content from, or deliver content to the myKlovr Platform, and all documentation relating thereto, (ii) all financial information relating to
                    myKlovr or its affiliates, (iii) all product or service development plans of myKlovr or its affiliates, and (iv) all security vulnerabilities and information relating to actual or alleged security vulnerabilities or breaches of the
                    myKlovr Platform. By agreeing to these Terms, You acknowledge and agree that such information has independent economic value due to it not being generally known or available to others, and that myKlovr takes reasonable measures to
                    protect the confidentiality and secrecy of such information. You agree not to, and warrant and represent that You will not engage in any activity, assist any third party in engaging in any activity, or attempt in any way, or assist
                    any third party in attempting in any way, to (v) discover or use any trade secrets of myKlovr without myKlovr’s prior written consent, (vi) reverse engineer or otherwise discover any source code utilized by the myKlovr Platform or
                    any client or other software provided by Us, (vii) breach, discover, circumvent, disable or otherwise compromise any security, encryption, password protection, or other feature or mechanism used by Us or the myKlovr Platform to protect
                    the myKlovr Platform or any website or any data, hardware, software or server used in connection with it, (viii) use the myKlovr Platform to provide unsolicited electronic communications (a.k.a. Spam) or distribute any infringing or
                    illegal content, (ix) use the myKlovr Platform or any client or software provided by Us for any illegal, immoral, or improper purpose, (x) prevent or inhibit access to (or use of) the myKlovr Platform by any person, or (xi) publish,
                    reproduce, or use for any purpose other than as expressly contemplated under this Agreement, any content on or available through the myKlovr Platform. You further warrant and represent that You will not use the myKlovr Platform or
                    any client or software provided by Us to implement, develop, refine, enhance, use, or promote any website, software or service that competes with the myKlovr Platform.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 9	LINKING, CRAWLING AND FRAMING.  </strong>The myKlovr Platform, and any content or resource viewed through the myKlovr Platform, is available for Your personal and non-commercial use (and any commercial uses expressly
                    permitted under Separate Agreements, if any) only. This includes the recommendations, suggested resources and products as well as the content items. You may link only to the home page of this website, and not to any other page or portion
                    of the myKlovr Platform. You agree not to, and warrant and represent that You will not assist any third party in engaging in any activity or attempting in any way, to reproduce, in whole or in part, any content provided by the myKlovr
                    Platform through any method (including, without limitation, through copying, caching, or framing), unless such access is expressly permitted in a written agreement executed by myKlovr. You may not, for instance, incorporate the information,
                    content, or other material in any database, compilation, archive, API or cache. Except as specifically authorized by myKlovr, You may not deep-link to the myKlovr Platform for any purpose or access the myKlovr Platform manually or

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 18.2	</strong>Subject to Section 19 (Disputes), the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for all legal actions arising out of this Agreement shall be in an appropriate court sitting in New York, New York, or the United States

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 18.3	</strong>You agree and acknowledge that any breach or threatened breach by You of this Agreement may cause myKlovr irreparable injury for which the recovery of money damages would be inadequate. Therefore, in addition
                    to any other remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise, myKlovr shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving actual damages,
                    or posting a bond, even if otherwise normally required.</p>

                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 19	DISPUTES.  </strong>With the exception of injunctive relief (which either party may seek as they deem necessary to avoid irreparable damage or preserve the status quo), any dispute between the parties arising out of
                    or related to this Agreement shall be resolved as follows:</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 19.1	</strong>Good Faith Efforts to Resolve Disputes. Upon the written request of either party, each party will appoint a designated representative whose task it will be to meet for the purpose of resolving such dispute.
                    Each designated representative shall have the authority to reach a binding resolution of the dispute through amiable discussions, the exchange of documents, and/or meetings. The designated representatives shall negotiate in good faith
                    in an effort to resolve the dispute without the necessity of any formal proceeding relating thereto.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 19.2	</strong>Arbitration. All disputes that have not been resolved by the designated representatives within thirty (30) days after said initial written request by one of the parties to appoint a designated representative,
                    shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall be by a panel of one (1) qualified arbitrators experienced in the matters at issue.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 19.3	</strong>Selecting the Arbitrator. You and myKlovr shall negotiate in good faith to select a qualified arbitrator for no less than thirty (30) days after the initiation of the arbitration proceedings as set forth in
                    Section 19.4 below. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within such thirty (30) day period, the American Arbitration Association shall, upon the request of any party to the dispute or difference, appoint the arbitrator to
                    constitute the panel. The Arbitrator must be a retired judge or a working or retired attorney with experience in drafting or litigating online services agreements.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 19.4	</strong>Initiating Arbitration Proceedings. Either You or myKlovr may initiate arbitration proceedings under this Section 19 by making a written request to the American Arbitration Association, together with any appropriate
                    filing fee.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 19.5	</strong>Location of Arbitration Proceedings. All arbitration proceedings shall be held in New York, New York, U.S.A., in a location to be specified by the arbitrators or any other place agreed to collectively by the
                    parties and the arbitrators.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 19.6	</strong>Binding Orders. Any order or determination of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding upon the parties to the arbitration as to matters submitted and may be enforced by either party in any court having
                    jurisdiction over the subject matter or over any of the parties.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 19.7	</strong>Costs and Expenses of Arbitration. All parties will pay their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such arbitration proceeding, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’, accountants’
                    and consultants’ fees, experts’ fees, and filing fees regardless of outcome. All fees and expenses charged by the arbitrator or the AAA shall be borne equally by the parties.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 19.8	</strong>Court Proceedings. The Parties understand and agree that the exclusive means of resolving any dispute arising in connection with this Agreement shall be arbitration as set forth in this Section 19. Neither
                    party may bring a court action or other proceeding (either as an individual or as part of a class) to enforce or interpret this Agreement, the parties having agreed that all such disputes shall be resolved exclusively through arbitration.
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything else in this Agreement, myKlovr may bring an action in any court of suitable jurisdiction for injunctive or similar equitable relief in the event myKlovr determines that You or Your actions
                    are putting, or have put, myKlovr’s Confidential Information or Intellectual Property at risk.</p>

                        to Us via the completion of a registration form or in an email You send to Us). The types of Personal Information that We may request include, without limitation, Your name, age, academic performance history, the educational institution
                        in which You are enrolled, Your employer, job title, department, mailing address, email address, and telephone number. Where there are links between the myKlovr Platform and third party sites or social networks, We may collect
                        account information for accounts You use on those third party sites or social networks. In some instances, We may also collect the geo-location data of Your mobile or other device, including, without limitation, GPS-based, Wi-Fi-based,
                        or cell-based location information. Even though We don’t view them as “Personal Information,” We may also collect Your internet protocol (IP) address, MAC address, or other machine or network identifiers as You access the myKlovr
                        Platform. Payment card and financial institution information is collected through our third-party vendors or service providers. We do not store credit card or financial institution information. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">We require registration in order for You to use certain features of the myKlovr Platform. As part of the registration process You will be required to provide Us with Personal Information. Some of the Personal Information that We ask
                        You to provide is mandatory and some is voluntary. If You do not provide the mandatory information, You may not be able to use the myKlovr Platform or Your use may be limited to only certain portions. We reserve the right to change
                        which parts of the Website require registration, and which do not, as We modify and update the myKlovr Platform.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> 3.2 Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may update Your Personal Information via the myKlovr Platform. If You should become aware that Your Personal Information with myKlovr is not complete and accurate, You must promptly update Your Personal Information via Your account.
                        It is Your obligation to ensure that Your Personal Information is kept up to date. We may backup or replicate Personal Information stored through the myKlovr Platform for disaster recovery or other purposes. Updates to your Personal
                        Information will not necessarily be reflected in such backups or replicated data when You make those updates. In the event that any Personal Information is shared with third parties (as permitted in this Privacy Policy), updates
                        will not be reflected in the data stored by those third parties unless or until they request an update from myKlovr and myKlovr provides that update (once again, where permitted by this Privacy Policy).</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> 3.3 Online Tracking</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">We, and certain service providers operating on Our behalf, collect information about Your activity on the myKlovr Platform and applications using tracking technologies such as cookies. Such technologies are widely used in order to
                        make websites work, or work more efficiently, and to help Us better understand how people use the myKlovr Platform. In addition, We may utilize third party advertising arrangements that involve the use of cookies or web bugs or
                        similar technologies to help ensure that any advertising delivered to You by us or third parties is relevant to Your interests. myKlovr and its designees may use these technologies when You interact with the myKlovr Platform. If
                        You disable these technologies in Your browser, the myKlovr Platform may not operate correctly and You may not be able to use certain of its features. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> 3.4 Adult Audiences Only</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The myKlovr Platform is intended to be used only by persons over 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information or other information from or about children. You agree to notify Us immediately in writing via Your
                        myKlovr account, or by mail at 1350 Avenue of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, New York, 10019, or by email at support@myklovr.com, if You become aware that We have received information from or about any such individuals. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> 3.5 Third Party Sites</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of Our services may be provided through sites that bear the names and trademarks of Our partners or suppliers, and that are not under Our control. In addition, the myKlovr Platform may contain links or other devices that take
                        You to other websites that are also not within Our control, or pull content from such websites for display on the myKlovr Platform. Certain of those other websites may provide products or services to You directly or on Our behalf.
                        We are not responsible for any aspect of other websites, including, without limitation, the privacy practices, products, services, or content of such websites. This Privacy Policy will not apply to such other websites. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rather, Your activity and the information that You provide at such other websites will be subject to the privacy policies and other terms and conditions posted at such other websites. You are responsible for reviewing those privacy
                        policies and other terms and conditions prior to providing any Personal Information to those sites, regardless of whether or not You access them in connection with Your use of the myKlovr Platform. In particular, payment information
                        for products and services You purchase through the myKlovr Platform are provided by our third party payment processing service providers. All payment information You provide will be subject to the privacy policies and terms of
                        use of those third party providers. If you have any difficulty locating terms or privacy policies for our payment processing providers, please contact support@myKlovr.com and we will help you find them.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> 4.  How We Use the Personal Information We Gather</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Personal Information that You provide to Us is processed and stored on the servers located within the United States. We may change the location of the servers from time to time, including to other countries, and without prior notice
                        to You. Your Personal Information, however, will continue to be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In the event of a change of ownership or restructuring of myKlovr (in whole or in part), any or all Personal Information
                        maintained by myKlovr may be transferred to another entity, and such entity may then change this Privacy Policy in accordance with the myKlovr Terms and Conditions. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">myKlovr may store and use Your Personal Information and, without further notice to You, may provide Your Personal Information to myKlovr affiliates or to third parties in order for Us, Our affiliates or third parties to:</p>

                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li>A. support Our intent to provide, maintain, and improve usability of the myKlovr Platform;</li>
                        <li>B. collect and distribute payments;</li>
                        <li>C. provide You with technical support;</li>
                        <li>D. provide You with access to restricted areas of the myKlovr Platform; </li>
                        <li>E. comply with legal requirements, including, without limitation, governmental orders, civil subpoenas, or discovery requests; </li>
                        <li>F. enforce the Terms and Conditions of this Privacy Policy and the Terms governing use of the myKlovr Platform, including, without limitation, the investigation of potential violations or suspected illegal activities; </li>
                        <li>G. protect the rights, property, safety, or security of myKlovr, any of Our users or the public, or to respond to an emergency; or</li>
                        <li>H. accomplish or attempt to accomplish any other lawful purpose.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some data, including, but not limited to, the types of services used and the numbers of users We receive daily in various parts of the myKlovr Platform, may be used for statistical, marketing, promotional, or any other lawful purposes.
                        This kind of information is collected in aggregate/statistical form, without identifying any user individually, and may be shared with or sold to third parties, subject to applicable laws and regulations. Aggregate data that does
                        not identify specific individuals is not Personal Information.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p><strong>5.   Protection of the Personal Information We Gather</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">myKlovr has implemented industry-standard measures to protect the security of the Personal Information We collect via the myKlovr Platform. The financial partners We use to collect and process payment information are PCI DSS (Payment
                        Card Industry Data Security Standard) certified. Regardless of what measures are used to protect Personal Information, no one can guarantee, and We do not guarantee, that Your Personal Information is completely secure at all times.
                        If We determine that Your Personal Information was accessed in an improper manner, We will comply with applicable laws as We understand them and will cooperate with internal investigators or law enforcement (including by possibly
                        disclosing Your Personal Information to such investigators or law enforcement agencies). </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your Personal Information may also be accessed by anyone having the credentials You use to access the myKlovr Platform. Please understand that You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your Personal Information
                        to protect it against unauthorized access or use including, without limitation, by ensuring that any credentials that enable access to the myKlovr Platform use strong passwords and are not shared with any third party. To the maximum
                        extent permitted by applicable law, myKlovr disclaims any responsibility or liability for any misuse of Your Personal Information that results from illegal, improper, negligent, malicious, or inappropriate acts or omissions of
                        You or any third party, or from any conduct, other than willful conduct of myKlovr.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">myKlovr may retain Your Personal Information for as long as You continue to use the myKlovr Platform, and for as long thereafter as permitted or required by applicable law. If We delete Your Personal Information, it may still be contained
                        on backup media or other systems until such times as such media is destroyed or overwritten, or data on such other systems are otherwise deleted. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p><strong>6.   Your Rights</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In accordance with the applicable law, myKlovr will provide You with access to Your Personal Information and, as appropriate, the right to intervene in respect of Your Personal Information. You may also be entitled to request the deletion
                        of Your Personal Information, in which case, if myKlovr, in its sole discretion, deems deletion of such Personal Information as mandatory or appropriate, myKlovr may do so; provided, however that such deletion will mean that You
                        may no longer be permitted to engage in certain activities, and may not have any further access to records of Your use of the myKlovr Platform. Deletion of Personal Information in this way may also result in your forfeiture of
                        any usage credits or promotional credits earned by You prior to the deletion.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">For the purpose of exercising Your rights, You must submit a written request to Us in accordance with the applicable law via Your myKlovr account, or by mail at 1350 Avenue of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, New York, 10019, or
                        by email at support@myklovr.com. In addition, if You believe that myKlovr has not complied with this Privacy Policy with respect to Your Personal Information, please submit a sufficiently detailed complaint to Us in any of the
                        foregoing manners. We will promptly investigate Your complaint. Thereafter, We will take all measures We deem necessary to remedy the issues outlined in Your complaint that We, in Our sole discretion, view as justified. If myKlovr
                        deletes Personal Information, de-identified summaries, backup copies, and legal records may continue to contain portions of the Personal Information thereafter.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If You are under eighteen (18) years of age, You or Your parent or legal guardian may request modification or deletion of Your Personal Information. myKlovr will respond to such requests whether made by You and may respond to requests
                        made by a person who represents to Us that he or she is your parent or guardian, if myKlovr does not have a good faith basis for disbelieving such representations.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p><strong>7.   Your Choices</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">You can decide if You want to provide Your Personal Information to myKlovr. <strong>If You do not understand and agree to this Privacy Policy DO NOT provide Personal Information to Us. </strong> Please note, however, that if You do
                        not provide certain Personal Information, You may not be able to use the myKlovr Platform, or access certain features of the myKlovr Platform. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If You choose (through the myKlovr Platform) to receive communications regarding special offers, or any other information, We may add Your Personal Information to Our email database and use (or direct Our designees to use) Your Personal
                        Information for providing such communications to You. You may later choose to unsubscribe from receiving such communications by following the unsubscribe directions in Our communications. If You provide myKlovr with inconsistent
                        privacy preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that We may provide You with marketing offers and on another occasion that We may not), myKlovr will endeavor to update Your privacy preferences in myKlovr’s records
                        with Your latest preference in a timely manner, but We cannot guarantee how quickly such changes will take effect. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p><strong>8.   Questions or Concerns About this Privacy Policy; Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If You have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please send Your inquiry via e-mail to support@myklovr.com, or by mail to 1350 Avenue of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, New York, 10019. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">myKlovr reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting notice of the changes on the Website. For additional details concerning changes to this Privacy Policy, please see the Terms. You are responsible for reviewing
                        this Privacy Policy after being exposed to such postings. You can also determine if changes have been made, by noting the version information at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. If You do not agree with any of the changes that
                        have been made, Your sole remedy is to cease use of the myKlovr Platform and seek deletion of your Personal Information as described above.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the limitations of liability, dispute resolution requirements, disclaimers, and governing law provisions of the Terms will apply to and govern any actual or alleged claims relating
                        to this Privacy Policy. </p>

                    <p><strong>9.   FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ONLY - Your California Privacy Rights </strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a California resident using the myKlovr Platform, the following additional terms apply. </p>

                    <p><strong> 9.1 Do Not Track</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In some cases, some third parties that provide services to Us, such as for analytics, may be able to collect information about Your online activities when You use the myKlovr Platform. Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track"
                        signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether
                        they even are aware of them. Consequently, We do not take actions to respond to automated “Do Not Track” signals at the current time. However, You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar tracking
                        technologies through Your browser. You may set Your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require Your consent before a cookie is placed in Your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect Your
                        online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at the myKlovr Platform. Please consult the “Help” section of Your browser for more information.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If You are a California resident, You may request information about practices related to disclosing Your personal information to certain third parties and/or opt-out of sharing of Your information with unaffiliated third parties for
                        the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, if applicable. Please send Your request (along with your full name, e-mail address, postal address, and the subject line labeled “Your California Privacy Rights”) by e-mail at support@myklovr.com.</p>

                    <p><strong> 9.2 Notice for Minors</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If You are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of the myKlovr Platform, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits You to request and obtain removal of content or information You have
                        publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific content or information to support@myklovr.com. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive
                        removal of the content or information You have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.</p>

                    <p><strong> 9.3 SOPIPA Compliance</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">We do not knowingly engage in any of the following activities with respect to the myKlovr Platform: </p>

                        <li>(b) Use of information, including persistent unique identifiers, created or gathered by the myKlovr Platform to amass a profile about a K-12 student except in furtherance of K-12 school purposes.</li>

                        <li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">These restrictions do not apply to the myKlovr Platform’s use of information for maintaining, developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the myKlovr Platform. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">We agree to: (1) implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the covered information, and protect that information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure;
                        and (2) delete a student’s covered information if the school or district requests deletion of data under the control of the school or district.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the myKlovr Platform may disclose covered information under the following circumstances:</p>
